## Hyperledger ITT

Hyperledger ITT is a platform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned
by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality,
resiliency, flexibility and scalability. It is designed to support pluggable
implementations of different components, and accommodate the complexity and
intricacies that exist across the economic ecosystem.

Hyperledger ITT delivers a uniquely elastic and extensible architecture,
distinguishing it from alternative blockchain solutions. Planning for the
future of enterprise blockchain requires building on top of a fully-vetted,
open source architecture; Hyperledger ITT is your starting point.


## Release Roadmap

Please visit the [Hyperledger ITT wiki] for our release roadmap. We plan on a quarterly release cadence following the v1.1.0 release, delivering on a scoped set of themes and select features. Unless specified otherwise, all releases will be upgradable from the prior minor release.
